3. Create a source connector

Reads lines from input.txt and writes them to topic test-topic.

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{
  "name": "file-source",
  "config": {
    "connector.class": "FileStreamSource",
    "tasks.max": "1",
    "file": "/tmp/input.txt",
    "topic": "test-topic"
  }
}' http://localhost:8083/connectors


(Mount your local input.txt into /tmp/input.txt in the container if needed.)

4. Create a sink connector

Reads from test-topic and writes to output.txt.

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{
  "name": "file-sink",
  "config": {
    "connector.class": "FileStreamSink",
    "tasks.max": "1",
    "topics": "test-topic",
    "file": "/tmp/output.txt"
  }
}' http://localhost:8083/connectors
